I am a computer science M.S. student at Columbia University (Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science).
I previously received my B.A. in Computer Science and Mathematics at Columbia University (Columbia College).
You can reach me via email: <flq2101@columbia.edu>.

My main focus is research in the field of programming language theory. In particular, my work is related to program synthesis, reactive systems, type systems and compilers. See [Research](/research), [Projects](/projects) and [CV](/cv) for more info.

I also enjoy travelling and landscape photography. You can see some photos at the [Photography](/photography) page.
